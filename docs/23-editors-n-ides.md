Editors, IDEs, Style formatters and Linters for various languages.

## Editors & IDEs

### Editors

The first requirement of Prettier is to output valid code that has the exact same behavior as before formatting. Please report any code where Prettier fails to follow these correctness rules — that's a bug which needs to be fixed!

### IDEs

Double or single quotes? Prettier chooses the one which results in the fewest number of escapes. `"It's gettin' better!"`, not `'It\'s gettin\' better!'`. In case of a tie, Prettier defaults to double quotes (but that can be changed via the [`--single-quote`](options.html#quotes) option).
