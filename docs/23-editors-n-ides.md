### Style formatters

| Name               | Language     |  extras    |  Notes2 |
| -------------      |:-------------   |-------------  |:-------------:| 
| YAPF            | Python          | supports multiple styles; so  YAPF > Black   |   |
| Black           | Python          | supports only ONE style  |     |
| Prettier           | JavaScript, React          | configurable, popular  |     |

An extension ( of VsCode) supports source code formatting using either autopep8 (the default), [black, or yapf.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing)

Both <b>YAPF & prettier</b> are integrated with Pycharm and other IDEs

### Linters

Why lint [your JavaScript?](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/why-and-how-to-use-eslint-in-your-project-742d0bc61ed7)

> Well run projects have clear consistent coding conventions, with automated enforcement. When I review a project, and its code looks like a house built by a child using nothing but a hatchet and a picture of a house, it doesnâ€™t inspire confidence that the code is functional.

> Not having coding conventions is also a barrier to attracting contributions, and depending on a project that does not welcome (quality!) contributions is itself a risk.

Keep your code [clean with ESLint](https://flaviocopes.com/eslint/)
