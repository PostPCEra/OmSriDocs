## Advancements in Deep Learning 
Following are major advancements in ML/Deep Learing models.

### 1. BERT: language model for NLP. 

BERT Explained: State of the art [language model for NLP](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270)

 It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including `Question Answering` (SQuAD v1.1), `Natural Language Inference` (MNLI), and others.

- TensorFlow code and [pre-trained models for BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)

 > BERT’s key technical innovation is `applying` the bidirectional training of Transformer, a popular `attention model, to language modelling`. This is in contrast to previous efforts which looked at a text sequence either from left to right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left training. The paper’s results show that a language model which is bidirectionally trained can have a deeper sense of language context and flow than single-direction language model.


## 2. Habitat AI: Habitat Platform for Embodied AI Research

- AI Habitat enables [training of embodied AI agents (virtual robots) in a highly photorealistic & efficient 3D simulator](https://medium.com/worasuchad/ai-habitat-4e9475a0275c), before transferring the learned skills to reality. This empowers a paradigm shift from ‘internet AI’ based on static datasets (e.g. ImageNet, COCO, VQA) to embodied AI where agents act within realistic environments, bringing to the fore active perception, long-term planning, learning from interaction, and holding a dialog grounded in an environment.

- Successful [real-world robotic applications call for a variety of skills](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/habitat-training-ground-for-embodied-ai-agents-4d1eea28ee3a) including visual perception, scene understanding, language understanding, and proper navigation skills.
- I wouldn’t say that tables have wholly turned, but while datasets have been significant drivers in computer vision and natural language processing progress, richly built simulators may soon start assuming their roles

### 9.SPTAG :A library for fast approximate nearest neighbor search

> A distributed approximate nearest neighborhood search (ANN) library which provides a high quality vector index build, search and distributed online serving toolkits for large scale vector search scenario.

## ML/DL Business Applications

### Trustpilot : Customer Review Analysis platform

- Trustpilot has 700 employees globally, raised VC funding $110 M , [started applying ML/DL recently](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/27/trustpilot-building-ai-for-your-company-means-not-falling-in-love/) . 
   
- How Staysure.co.uk maintains a Great TrustScore from 50,000 Reviews
Take the example of Staysure.co.uk, a UK-based insurance company that has collected over 50,000 reviews, most of which from happy customers. `They collect over 4,000 reviews per month`, which is almost impossible for any human to analyse and sort through.

- That’s why they chose to start using Trustpilot’s new AI tool - Review Insights - which analyses reviews almost instantly (to date, Trustpilot’s analysed 31 million reviews from various industries to deliver the best-in-class insights).

- Using the insights identified by the AI-powered tool, Staysure can now easily understand major customer concerns, and act to solve those issues before they become bigger problems.
