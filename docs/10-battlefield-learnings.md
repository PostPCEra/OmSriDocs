### Typescript-Mobx-React

How We Write [Front-end Code](https://heap.io/blog/engineering/how-we-write-front-end-code)
- With all the view, state management, and routing libraries out there, it can be hard to know how best to fit the pieces together. 
- Through writing many thousands of lines of code for the Heap web app, `we’ve found that certain principles have allowed us to move fast and ship powerful features without compromising on testability or extensibility`.
- We also make extensive use of Lodash and used Lodash functions when we write our MobX store.
- When designing React components, we’ve found the `separation of container and presentational components to be invaluable`
- We’ll use `Mocha, Chai, and Enzyme` to test our container component:
- sr: you need Typescript `for all those interfaces and Abstract clsses` (in this Heap code), plain ES6 JS won't cut it.

### Heap Interviews 
Finding [a Better Way to Interview Engineers](https://heap.io/blog/engineering/finding-a-better-way-to-interview-engineers)
 - Like most startups, we want to build a team that ships software fast and at high quality. How should we interview engineers?
 - How do you make a decision based on a few hours of interaction that someone will be a great engineer over the course of multiple years? What does it even mean for someone to be a “great engineer”? This gets at even deeper questions about what kind of team you want to build. Our answer was that we wanted to `ship high-value features at high quality and high velocity`. How do you interview for that?
 - We set out to try something new, with `a guiding principle in mind: make the interview resemble the job as much as possible`.
